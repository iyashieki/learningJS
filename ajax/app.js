//*AJAX

//? AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

//? AJAX is not a programming language.
//? AJAX just uses a combination of: 
//?     A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server) 
//?    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

//? AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.


//create a new XMLHttpRequest object
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
console.log(xhr);
